# autohooks-plugin-pytest

[![PyPI release](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/autohooks-plugin-pytest.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/autohooks-plugin-pytest/)

An [autohooks](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks) plugin for python code
linting via [pytest](https://github.com/PyCQA/pytest).

## Installation

### Install using pip

You can install the latest stable release of autohooks-plugin-pytest from the
Python Package Index using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/):

    pip install autohooks-plugin-pytest

Note the `pip` refers to the Python 3 package manager. In a environment where
Python 2 is also available the correct command may be `pip3`.

### Install using poetry

It is highly encouraged to use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for
maintaining your project's dependencies. Normally autohooks-plugin-pytest is
installed as a development dependency.

    poetry install

## Usage

To activate the pytest autohooks plugin please add the following setting to your
*pyproject.toml* file.

```toml
[tool.autohooks]
pre-commit = ["autohooks.plugins.pytest"]
```

By default, autohooks plugin pytest checks all files with a *.py* ending. If
only files in a sub-directory or files with different endings should be
formatted, just add the following setting:

```toml
[tool.autohooks]
pre-commit = ["autohooks.plugins.pytest"]

[tool.autohooks.plugins.pytest]
include = ['foo/*.py', '*.foo']
```

By default, autohooks plugin pytest executes pytest without any arguments and
pytest settings are loaded from the *.pytestrc* file in the root directory of
git repository. To change specific settings or to define a different pytest rc
file the following plugin configuration can be used:

```toml
[tool.autohooks]
pre-commit = ["autohooks.plugins.pytest"]

[tool.autohooks.plugins.pytest]
arguments = ["--rcfile=/path/to/pytestrc", "-s", "n"]
```
